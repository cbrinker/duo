Duo: A powerful, dynamic, pythonic interface to AWS DynamoDB
------------------------------------------------------------

Duo provides a few straightforward, Pythonic abstractions for working
with Amazon Web Services' DynamoDB. It's a very light wrapper around
`boto.dynamodb.layer2`, so you have full access to that excellent
library when you need it, but you don't have to sweat the details when
you don't.
